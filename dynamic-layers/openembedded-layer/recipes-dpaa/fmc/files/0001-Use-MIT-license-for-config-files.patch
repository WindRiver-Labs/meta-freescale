+ * -------------------------------
+ *
+ * Some files in the Freescale FMC package are generated from skeleton files
+ * associated with the Flex and Bison programs.
+ *
+ * The Bison skeleton files are distributed under GPLv2 but with the following
+ * special exception (which applies to the Freescale FMC package):
+ *
+ *  As a special exception, you may create a larger work that contains
+ * part or all of the Bison parser skeleton and distribute that work
+ * under terms of your choice, so long as that work isn't itself a
+ * parser generator using the skeleton or a modified version thereof
+ * as a parser skeleton.  Alternatively, if you modify or redistribute
+ * the parser skeleton itself, you may (at your option) remove this
+ * special exception, which will cause the skeleton and the resulting
+ * Bison output files to be licensed under the GNU General Public
+ * License without this special exception.
+ *
+ * The Flex skeleton file is unrestricted.  It's License statement states,
+ * in reference to the license of the flex tool itself (which is 2-clause BSD):
+ *
+ * Note that the "flex.skl" scanner skeleton carries no copyright notice.
+ * You are free to do whatever you please with scanners generated using
+ * flex; for them, you are not even bound by the above copyright.
+ *
+ * Only the generated scanner is contained in the Freescale FMC package.
